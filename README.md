- 👋 Hi, I’m Weronika Kaśkosz. I'm from Zawiercie but I have been living in Warsaw since 2019.
- 👀 I have been interested in Flutter since February of this year. I met this framework and I fell in love at first sight :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write code in Dart and I'm creating my first app about recipes for dinners and cakes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a company where I could develop myself under the supervision of specialists. I'm interested in an internship.
